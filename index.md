## About Me

I'm a second-year Information Science PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh working with [Prof. Yu-Ru Lin](http://www.yurulin.com/). I am primarily interested in studying how individuals interact and behave in digital spaces. My research centers on understanding what captures people's attention online, how information spreads, and how communities form and evolve within cyber-social spaces, as well as the impact of network structures on social behaviors and dynamics. I explore these topics using computational methods and NLP tools to analyze large-scale data sets from various online platforms such as Twitter and FB. Through my work, I aim to uncover insights into how individuals engage in digital communities and how these interactions shape our online world.

<!-- Prior to this, I worked as a Research Assistant at the [Third Space Research Group](https://thirdspace.toronto.edu/) at the University of Toronto under [Prof. Ishtiaque Ahmed](https://www.ishtiaque.net/) and [Prof. Shebuti Rayana](http://shebuti.com/) (SUNY Old Westbury) on Covid-19 Stigma Detection on Twitter. I also worked as a Research Assistant at the [AISys Lab](https://github.com/softsys4ai) at the University of South Carolina under [Prof. Pooyan Jamshidi](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/) on Causal Transfer Learning. -->
