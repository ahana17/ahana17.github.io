## About Me

I'm a first-year Information Science PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh working with [Prof. Yu-Ru Lin](http://www.yurulin.com/). I am primarily interested in understanding how misinformation spreads in cyber-social spaces.

Prior to this, I worked as a Research Assistant at the [Third Space Research Group](https://thirdspace.toronto.edu/) at the University of Toronto under [Prof. Ishtiaque Ahmed](https://www.ishtiaque.net/) and [Prof. Shebuti Rayana](http://shebuti.com/) (SUNY Old Westbury) on Covid-19 Stigma Detection on Twitter. I also worked as a Research Assistant at the [AISys Lab](https://github.com/softsys4ai) at the University of South Carolina under [Prof. Pooyan Jamshidi](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/) on Causal Transfer Learning.
